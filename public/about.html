    <div class="para-a">
      <p>
        Hi there! I'm a passionate
        <span class="highlight">Computer Science</span> undergrad, set to
        graduate in <span class="special">2026</span>, with a keen interest in
        blending <span class="emphasis">technology</span> and
        <span class="creative">creativity</span>. My journey in tech and design
        has been fueled by a fascination with
        <span class="emphasis">web development</span>,
        <span class="creative">creative coding</span>, and user-focused design.
        Recently, I've been diving into <span class="highlight">p5.js</span>,
        <span class="highlight">Three.js</span>, and
        <span class="emphasis">Tailwind CSS</span> to bring dynamic, visually
        engaging web projects to life. Whether it's designing minimal, impactful
        logos or developing interactive web experiences, I thrive on crafting
        meaningful connections between ideas and audiences. As a
        <span class="highlight">content manager</span> in the insurance
        brokerage industry, I've honed my ability to create engaging, strategic
        content for platforms like <span class="emphasis">LinkedIn</span> and
        <span class="emphasis">Instagram</span>, aiming to boost reach and
        relevance. One of my latest projects involves building an online
        presence for <span class="highlight">SecureHapp Educare</span>, helping
        students find educational opportunities abroad, and
        <span class="highlight">PIB Insurance Brokers</span>, where I’ve been
        focused on driving engagement and brand visibility. I’m also exploring
        opportunities to study <span class="emphasis">Computer Science</span> at
        the master’s level in the <span class="creative">U.S.</span>, as I aim
        to deepen my expertise in emerging fields like
        <span class="highlight">AI</span>,
        <span class="highlight">machine learning</span>, and network
        technologies—areas I had a chance to witness up close at events like
        Nokia’s NBUC. Events like these fuel my drive to stay ahead in tech, and
        I love collaborating with like-minded innovators to build
        <span class="future-ready">future-ready</span>
        solutions. Design is a huge part of my identity, too. From creating
        t-shirt designs for college fests to developing brand identities, I
        bring a unique aesthetic to my work. I enjoy experimenting with
        dark-mode designs, often favoring a black-and-white palette paired with
        <span class="highlight">Helvetica</span> for a clean, modern look. I see
        myself evolving as a
        <span class="highlight">creative developer</span> where tech and design
        intersect, and I’m continuously working to expand my skill set—whether
        it’s in <span class="emphasis">embedded SQL</span>,
        <span class="emphasis">NoSQL databases</span>, or mastering the latest
        tools for creating interactive, visually captivating digital
        experiences. When I’m not coding or designing, I’m either exploring
        nature on short getaways, like my recent trip to
        <span class="highlight">Ramnagaram</span> and
        <span class="highlight">Chikmagalur</span>, or participating in
        challenges like the
        <span class="emphasis">365 Poster Challenge</span> to stay inspired and
        push my creative boundaries. Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to
        connect—I’m always open to new projects, collaborations, and ideas!
